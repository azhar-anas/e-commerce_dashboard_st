This repository contains an interactive e-commerce dashboard built with Streamlit for a comprehensive analysis of key business metrics. This project serves as the final submission for the "[Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/555-belajar-analisis-data-dengan-python)" class from Dicoding. The dashboard provides clear insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and delivery efficiency through a series of dynamic visualizations.

Key insights include:
- Visualize total revenue and delivered orders over a specified period to identify sales trends.
- Analyze customer distribution by state and city, and segment them based on Payment Type.
- Evaluate average, minimum, and maximum delivery times to optimize logistics.
- Identify the **Best Customers** based on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) parameters** to inform marketing and retention strategies.
